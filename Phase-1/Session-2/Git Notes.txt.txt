	> echo "Hello World!" > file.txt
	or simpli you can create  the files dircetly in the folder
Step:3 add the file or files to the stagging Area (to prepare the file to get ready to move to the remote repository)

	> ls               // list of files available
	> git rm --cached file.txt      // remove the file from stagging

	> git log --oneline     //short logs in one line only
Step:6 check the difference in the files
	> git diff <file1ID> <file2ID>    //this id u can get it from  git  log --oneline
Step:7 to set glabal username
